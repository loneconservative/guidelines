If you’re a conservative student with an interest in political commentary, journalism, or communications, Lone Conservative is the place to be.

Contributors have the opportunity to write political commentary and report on campus bias. Their work is personally edited and published on the Lone Conservative website. Contributors are also provided with training opportunities to help polish their media skills. As contributors become more involved over time, they’re encouraged to explore additional roles with the organization, which can include editing, social media, recruiting, development, and more.

Lone Conservative accepts submissions from high school and college students from around the world. If you have a story, let us know. Our editors are more than willing to work with you to refine and share your work.

Lone Conservative does not guarantee that your application will be accepted, or any submitted article will be published.

Once accepted, contributors will be invited to join our Slack community, where they will have the opportunity to connect with like-minded students from around the country and even the world. This includes optional Bible studies, book clubs, and more.

We hope to hear from you!

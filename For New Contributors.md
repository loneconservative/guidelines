# For New Contributors

We’re always happy to bring on new contributors to the team, and our team loves welcoming new people into the fold. We’ve done our best to sketch out a few guidelines for incoming contributors. If you’ve emailed us asking for more information about how to be a contributor, you probably ended up here.

If you’ve contacted us about covering a specific topic or issue, or have been asked specifically to cover one, we’ll send you further guidelines directly.

**Please do not send us finished articles which you expect us to publish. Please send us a topic proposal first, then wait for approval.** At the very least, this ensures we do not have five people writing about the same topic.

If you’re interested in joining the team and contributing in whatever way, we would like you to do the following:

1. Read through this guide, as well as our past articles and media, and make sure you’re familiar with our site’s content and tone.
2. If you haven’t already, tell us a bit about yourself, including where we can find you on social media. We do ask our contributors to provide a 1-2 sentence bio (written in 3rd person, preferably), and a photo (cropped square) to accompany their work on the site.
3. Unless you’ve already done so, pitch us 2-3 topics you’d be interested to write about. Before doing so, make sure this is a topic that hasn’t already been covered in an identical fashion, and one that meets our guidelines.
4. Our editors will review these pitches and most likely pick one that will be best. Unless we specifically reject any, you are more than welcome to contribute the others, as well.
5. Sign our contributor contract.

Please note that at this time, we are not accepting high school students as contributors, unless we have indicated we will make an exception.

While we are always excited to consider new contributors to the team, we do reserve the right to reject applications, or submissions, at will. If a submitted article is far outside our stated guidelines, it will be rejected, and we will do our best to explain why. We do review our contributors’ social media before acceptance. We outline what we expect from our contributors in the Personal Expectations section.

**If you are a student, we will request that you contact us from a student email address to verify your status.** We do not accept anonymously-written pieces. If you feel a specific need to publish under a pseudonym, we can accommodate upon request.

Lone Conservative does not ask contributors to sign noncompete agreements. We welcome our authors publishing as many places as possible.

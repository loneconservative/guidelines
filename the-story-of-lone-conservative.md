# The Story of Lone Conservative

In 2016, Kassy Dillon attended a College Republican event at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and caught on camera a now-infamous student protester known as “Trigglypuff.” This chance incident resulted in a sudden surge in media attention, which she used to create Lone Conservative, a group blog for conservative students who felt isolated on campus due to their political beliefs.

Since then, Lone Conservative \(which we tend to refer to as LoCo, cheekily\), has been a home for students and young conservatives to network and share their voices. Our first articles covered the shock of being a conservative on an otherwise liberal college campus, while others have covered conservative ideology and theory from the perspective of a student.

As students progress through college and beyond, they are presented with opportunities to consider what they believe, and why. The chance to express those beliefs, constructively debate them, and further refine them, only strengthens and sharpens them for life ahead. Lone Conservative was created as a platform to give students this chance, without being an echo chamber that reinforces belief without challenging it.

Throughout the 2016 election, Lone Conservative grew in size, saw its articles go viral on social media, and amassed millions of page views. As conservatism seeks to redefine itself in the wake of the election, we hope to be a home of strong ideology and lasting belief. Between our articles, newsletters, podcasts, and more, we offer numerous formats to share our beliefs and those of our contributors, in ways that best suit them.

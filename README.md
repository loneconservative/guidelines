# Lone Conservative Contributor Guidelines

When Lone Conservative started, we were a group of college students in a Facebook message group encouraging each other to write and share stories. Over a year later, Lone Conservative has grown beyond simply sharing stories of college experiences to being a platform that gives young conservatives a voice and opportunity to grow their experience in the fields of writing, journalism, and political activism.

Lone Conservative offers a platform for students, by students, to share their thoughts on politics, current events, and conservative campus culture. Our target audience is millennials in college, just out of college, or about to enter college. In an academic world in which liberalism abounds and insanity is a daily occurrence, it can be hard to be a campus conservative. If you've encountered something on campus that you find illogical, nonsensical, or just plain weird, we want to hear about it. Whether you’re a campus conservative feeling insecure about your ideology or repressed from speaking your mind, or a graduate hoping to better network with other young conservatives, we hope to be a new home for you.

While we have an organizational structure behind our editorial and media departments, our site, focus, and vision can be tremendously influenced by our team, collectively. This includes you. You aren’t just a “contributor” to Lone Conservative: you’re a valuable part of our community whose voice is always welcome. We aren’t a collective hivemind of likeminded political ideologues; we actively debate and argue over issues as they happen. Perhaps one day we’ll publish an article, only to publish another with a different perspective the next day. Lone Conservative is what you make of it.

With this guide, we hope to give you a sense of what Lone Conservative is all about, what’s expected of you, and how we can help you contribute your best. While we may be ideological with our statement of principles, in other sections, we’ll get down to specific details, and hopefully cover everything in between at some point.

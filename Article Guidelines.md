# Article Guidelines

Your articles should be written with the intent of educating and encouraging readers, not simply calling out or making fun of your ideological opponent. Don't just make ad hominem attacks: argue why a liberal idea is wrong. If your piece is negative for the sake of being negative, we will reject it. If your piece is written with the obvious purpose of seeking a retweet or follow from some specific conservative figure you admire, we will ask you to rewrite your piece.

We always appreciate first person narratives about campus experiences, but we expect you to be rational and level-headed. If the purpose of your piece is “I can’t believe people are this stupid,” meant to portray yourself as a hero, we will ask you to rewrite your piece.

In short, if the point of your article is “look at me because I triggered these stupid liberals, lol!,” _we will ask you to rewrite your piece_.

Don't give us a high school-style five-paragraph essay, and don't submit academic essays. Your work should be original and written with publishing in mind. 500-900 words is ideal for an article, and your arguments should be well-constructed and thoughtful.

Be thoughtful, rational, and cite sources whenever possible. Put your ideas in their proper context. You can argue a point as effectively as you want, but it is not sufficient to rely solely on logic: you should show us how you came to this conclusion through external evidence.

We check all submissions for evidence of plagiarism, and will remove you from the Lone Conservative contributor team if we find evidence of such.

## Feeling Stuck?

Ask for help. Our article topics channel in Slack is there both so that we can know who’s working on what, and also discuss ideas for articles as they come to you. Don’t be afraid to pitch an idea, even if you think it’s dumb. Maybe no one else will think it’s dumb, or perhaps someone will be able to quickly find a way to make it work after all. There’s no competition to see who can write the best article or the most articles. Sometimes we collaborate on articles behind the scenes.

We understand that writing can be the best way to think through what’s in your head, and sometimes you get stuck halfway through. Don’t give up. Even if you can’t come back to the topic, perhaps someone else can pick up where you left off.

We’re in this together, and want to see each other do their best work.

## Publishing Requirements

All submitted pieces should be sent as a Google Doc, shared with contactus@loneconservative.com.

If your article contains pictures, please attach them separately, not as part of the document.

Your article will be sent to the editors and reviewed. We may or may not follow up before publication. We will do our best to be in communication but cannot guarantee it.

## Article Ownership

Upon publication of a piece by Lone Conservative, we take ownership of that specific work. This has been a contentious issue for some contributors, but is in fact a standard procedure for publications. While we take ownership of that article itself, we do not claim ownership to the ideas behind it, or any other works written or created by you. If you wish to write a separate, derivative article based on the same idea and give it to another site, we cannot lay claim to it.

As we stipulate in our contributor contract, you are allowed to republish your own articles on a personal blog or social media. However, we ask that you make mention that the article was originally published on Lone Conservative, and include a link back to the original piece.

If your piece appears in another publication without permission after it is published on Lone Conservative, it will be our duty and responsibility to request its removal, and possibly take legal action if required.

If a pitch or article is denied, you are free to submit it to another publication with no hard feelings. However, please give us a heads up about this to avoid any confusion.

If you’re still confused by this, or have any concerns, let us know, and we’ll be happy to discuss them with you.

## Our Editorial Process

When you email us a new article for submission, we post it in our Google Drive, which our editorial team all has access to. Our editor-in-chief, Elizabeth, will internally assign a pair of editors to your piece, and they will both review and revise your piece as needed.

During editing, the editors will copy/paste the original text of your article to the bottom of the document, to refer back to it quickly as needed. Please do not modify anything but the topmost revision of the article.

Please note that if you have access to the document during editorial review, _please do not make further revisions to it_. Please contact one of the editors if a change needs to be made.

When your article will be published is at the discretion of the editor-in-chief. The decision when to publish may be made last minute, so we cannot and will not in most cases offer advance notice of when an article will be published. Most articles are published at 8:00 a.m. ET.

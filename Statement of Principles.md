# Statement of Principles

Sixty years after William F. Buckley stood athwart history, we intend to create a form of American conservatism for the new millennium: one which is undergirded by principles from time immemorial, but yet responsive to what our nation is confronted by in the present day. Almost two centuries after Benjamin Disraeli conceived of one nation conservatism for the United Kingdom, we work to create a uniquely American one nation conservatism for our nation. 

Such a conservatism is not to be paternalistic, but a facilitator to enable all Americans to be free to pursue their potential. It will not dictate personal lives; while respectful of tradition such a conservatism will preserve individual liberty. And such a conservatism wants a single, united, American nation that is strong and internationally respected leader, but will responsibly exercise its power. 

The fundamentals of American civil society have evolved in the last several decades. At the time of this writing in May 2017, the very future of American conservatism is open to debate and interpretation. 

In this endeavor, Lone Conservative is conceived as a response to the isolation and dogmatism characteristic of many institutions of learning in our nation.. We are a community of student leaders and writers with a diversity of ideas and philosophies including and ranging to the right of the American political center. We are committed to the production and dissemination of truthful, informative, and thought provoking content in the tradition of our nation’s greatest thinkers and movers. We are inspired by truth, liberty, and integrity, and seek to instill these values into America’s political discourse. 

History is made by those who show up, and we invite you to join us in translating timeless principles - respect for life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness - into defining what our generation’s one nation American conservatism will be.

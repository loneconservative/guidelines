# Personal Conduct

While we at Lone Conservative are accepting of differing political ideologies for the sake of constructive debate and challenging each other, we do require a certain set of standards of our contributors.

In internal communication, e.g. email/Slack/Facebook, we expect you to be respectful and professional. Remember that other contributors and team members are thinking through issues on their own, and may come to different conclusions with a desire to debate. Some of our contributors have changed their political ideas dramatically, and have much different perspectives.

If you are a published contributor and have publicly affiliated yourself with Lone Conservative on social media or elsewhere, we do expect a basic level of professionalism. If your social media is filled with vulgarity and inappropriate content, we will not feature you in our Contributor Twitter list, or link to your social media on your articles. If you attack, name-call, or otherwise harass other contributors on social media, we reserve the right to remove you as a contributor. While we value freedom of expression, we also recognize that freedom comes with responsibility, and if we feel your public actions or speech is inappropriate or harmful to our organization, we may discuss your conduct with you or remove you as a contributor.

Essentially, we ask that you adhere to, or at least respect, our stance that conservatives should take a moral high ground and not engage in lowest common denominator politics for cheap shots and quick retweets.
